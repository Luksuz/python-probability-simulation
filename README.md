# Probability Simulation Library

## Overview

Welcome to the Probability Simulation Library which idea stemmed from Stat 210 Harvard course!(not) This Python library is an initial attempt to create tools to simulate various probability problems, including the Urn problem, the deck of cards problem, and the Monty Hall problem. Please note that this library is not yet complete and is a work in progress. It's perfect for anyone interested in learning or teaching probability concepts through simulation.

## Features

- **Urn Problem**: Simulate drawing balls from an urn with different configurations.
- **Deck of Cards Problem**: Simulate drawing cards from a standard deck of 52 cards.
- **Monty Hall Problem**: Simulate the famous Monty Hall problem and analyze the probabilities.
